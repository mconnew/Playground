A place where I drop snippets of code that I've created to explore ideas and concepts

| [HijackHttpWebRequest](HijackHttpWebRequest) | Code which enables modifying HttpWebRequest behavior when you don't have control of the creation or usage |
| [ConfigureServiceByEndpoint](ConfigureServiceByEndpoint) | Code which demonstrates using a custom IInstanceProvider to customize a service instance based on the request |
